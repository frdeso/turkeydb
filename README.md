# turkeydb
Pastebin.com backed key-value store.

Using this is probably a bad idea for anyone caring about performance. Don't use that!

##What do I have against turkeys?
Nothing. People say that it's one of the dumbest animal on Earth. Just like this key-value store.

##Why you should not use it?
- It's slow
- Limited to 25 updates (insert and delete) per 24h because Pastebin.com API rules.
- Limited to 500 KB of data
- No concurrency

##Why you should use it?
- Free of charge hosting of your datastore.
- Cool name
- To laugh your teammates
